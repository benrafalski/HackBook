    <h1>Basic Protocols</h1>
    <h2>Key Exchange</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>Session key:</u> Used to encrypt each individual conversation with a
        separate key
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Man in the middle attack:</u> Alice and Bob have no way to verify
        they are talking to each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Interlock protocol:</u> Tried to prevent mitm attack. Alice and Bob
        exchange half of their encrypted message, then exchagne the other half
        after that. Mallory cannot decrypt the first half of the message, he
        needs the whole message to decrypt it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Digital Signatures:</u> If Trent signs the public keys, Alice and Bob
        can trust them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Key-Message transmission:</u> Alice generates a session key and
        encrypts the message with it then encyrpts the session key with Bob's
        public key then sends both of them to Bob
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><u>One-way function:</u> used to store passwords</li>
      <li>
        <u>Salt:</u> random string concated to end of password before putting it
        through one-way function. Hash and salt are stored in the database
        together. Aims to prevent dictionary attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>SKEY:</u> Computer computes
        <i>x<sub>1</sub>=f(R), x<sub>2</sub>=f(f(R))</i> and so on for like 100
        times and Alice keeps the results, the computer keeps
        <i>x<sub>101</sub></i
        >. When Alice tries to login, she provides <i>x<sub>100</sub></i> and
        the computer computes <i>f(x<sub>101</sub>)</i>, if it matches Alice is
        authenticated. Next time, Alice uses <i>x<sub>99</sub></i
        >, decreasing each time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Public-key authentication:</u>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Alice performs computations on a random number and her private key
            and sends to host
          </li>
          <li>Host sends back a new random number</li>
          <li>
            Alice does some computations on both random numbers and her private
            key and sends back
          </li>
          <li>
            Host does computation on all the numbers and Alice's public key to
            verify Alice
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Mutual authentication:</u> If Alice and Bob both have passwords each
        other knows, they can exchange the passwords with public-key encryption
        and the Interlock Protocol to prevent a mitm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>SKID:</u> Use MAC and assume Alice and Bob share a secret key to
        compute the MAC. Is not secure against a mitm
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>SKID2:</u> Alice and Bob both come up with random numbers and
            Alice sends hers to Bob. Bob sends back a MAC of the two numbers and
            his name and his random number. Alice computes the MAC herself and
            compares it to what Bob sent to authenticate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>SKID3:</u> Provides mutual authentication. Same as SKID2 but
            Alice then sends back a MAC of Bob's random number and her name
            which Bob can use to authenticate her.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

        </li>

          Trent decrypts the message and sends to Bob

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

    <li>
      <u>Needham-Schroeder:</u> uses symmetric encryption. Problem is that
      previous session keys can be used to mitm at step 4 and if Alice's key
