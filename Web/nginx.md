# NGINX Cheatsheet

## Overview
If a website is using NGINX to serve their web content, when you make a request to get the web content it will go through NGINX and NGINX will serve the web content by interacting with the website's servers rather than the website's servers providing the content themselves. 

This is known as a reverse proxy
