        <h1>Intermediate Protocols</h1>
        <h2>Timestamping</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Arbitrated solution:</u> Alice sends a document to Trent and he timestamps it and keeps a copy before sending it back to Alice</li>
            <li><u>Improved arbitrated solution:</u> Same as arbitrated solution but Alice hashes the document before sending it and Trent digitally signs the document instead of keeping it in a database</li>
            <li><u>Linking solution:</u> Protects against Alice and Trent colluding with a fake timestamp. Alice's timestamp is linked to the previous (timestamp before her) and next (timestamp after her) so that her timestamp depends on the future, and cannot be faked.</li>
            <li><u>Distributed solution:</u> If the timestamps before or after Alice get lost she is screwed. Instead, Alice could get her hash timestamped and signed by <i>n</i> random people. The only way she could cheat is by getting all <i>n</i> people to cheat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Subliminal Channel</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Subliminal Channel:</u> Covert communication channel in plain view of an eavesdropper even though the messages themselves contain to secret info</li>
            <li>Protocol:
                <ol>
                    <li>Alice and Bob share a secret key</li>
                    <li>Alice makes a random message</li>
                    <li>Alice signs the message with the secret key so that a secret message is hidden in the signature</li>
                    <li>Walter is able to read the message as he passes it to Bob</li>
                    <li>Bob uses the secret key to reveal the subliminal message</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Requires that Alice and Bob trust each other since they share a private key</li>
            <li><u>Subliminal-free signature schemes:</u> Digital signature schemes that cannot be modified to contain subliminal channels</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Undeniable digital signatures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Problem:</u> Normal digital signatures can be copied exactly. This means if the signer signs something personal, anyone with their public key can verify they signed it.</li>
            <li><u>Undebiable signatures:</u> Like a normal digital signature but cannot be verified without the signer's consent.</li>
            <li>Protocol:
                <ol>
                    <li>Alice sends Bob a signature</li>
                    <li>Bob sends back to Alice a random number</li>
                    <li>Alice does a computation with her private key and the random number and sends it to Bob</li>
                    <li>Bob verifies the random number</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><u>Entrusted undeniable signature:</u> Undeniable signature but only Trent can prove who the signature really belongs to</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Designated confirmer signatures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Alice can sign a document so that Bob believes the signature is valid but he cannot convice a third-party and Alice can designate Carol as the confirmer of her signature using Carol's public key.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other digital signatures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Proxy signatures:</u> Alice gives Bob such that: the proxy is distinguishable from a normal signature, unforgable, always detected as a proxy, verifiable, identifiable (for Alice), undeniable.</li>
            <li><u>Group signatures:</u> Only members of a group can sign messages, the receiver of the signature can verify it is a valid one from the group, the receiver cannot identify who from the group is the signer, and if there is a dispute then Trent can reveal the signature to identify the signer</li>
            <li><u>Fail-stop signatures:</u> Allows Alice to prove that forges signatures are forgeries if her private key is brute forced. This is done by having multiple private keys for a single public key so that the attacker would need to brute force all the private keys.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Bit Commitment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Used when one side wants to make a secret prediction and the other side doesn't want this prediction to be able to change.</li>
            <li>Symmetric Protocol:
                <ol>
                    <li>Bob generates a random bit string and sends it to Alice</li>
                    <li>Alice chooses the bit she want to commit to and sends back <code>encrypt(Bob's random bit string|Alice's commited bit)</code> with a random key</li>
                    <li>When Alice is ready to reveal her bit, she sends Bob the key</li>
                    <li>Bob can now verify his random number and reveal the committed bit</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Hashing Protocol:
                <ol>
                    <li>Alice chooses two random bit strings and the bit she wants to commit and hashes them <code>hash(random string 1|random string 2|committed bit)</code></li>
                    <li>Alice then sends the hash and one of the random strings to Bob</li>
                    <li>When Alice wants to reveal her bit commitment, Alice sends Bob both the random strings and the committed bit</li>
                    <li>Bob can then verify the random numbers and committed bit</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Pseudo-Random Sequence Genrerator Protocol:
                <ol>
                    <li>Bob sends a random bit string to Alice</li>
                    <li>Alice then generates a random bit sequence using a random seed and sends Bob
                        <ul>
                            <li>the generated bit if Bob's bit is 0</li>
                            <li>XOR of the gerentated bit and Alice's committed bit if Bob's bit is 1</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When Alice wants to reveal her bit commitment, she sends Bob the random seed</li>
                    <li>Bob can then verify her committed bit</li>
                </ol>
            </li> 
            <li><u>Fair-coin flipping:</u> Alice chooses a random bit and commits it using a protocol above and if Bob guesses the bit correctly he wins. Fair coin flipping can be used for session key generation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mental Poker</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Mental poker:</u> Alice encrypts 52 cards with her public key, Bob chooses 5 at random and encypts them with his public key (i.e. <code>enrypt_bob(encrypt_alice(card))</code>). Alice can then decrypt them (doesn't reveal them though) and send them to Bob who can decrypt then to reveal them. They can then repeat this for Alice and for the rest of the game. This can also be extended to more than 2 players.</li>
            <li><u>Anonymous key distribution:</u>
                <ol>
                    <li>Alice makes a public/private key pair (but keeps both secret)</li>
                    <li>Trent begins generating a continuous stream of symmetric keys encrypted with his public key</li>
                    <li>Alice choses one random key and encrypts it with her public key (now show be <code>encrypt_alice(encrypt_trent(private key))</code>)</li>
                    <li>Trent decrypts the secret key (now should be <code>encrypt_alice(private key)</code>)</li>
                    <li>Alice decrypts the secret key to reveal it</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other protocols:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><u>One way Accululation:</u> If there is a membership database, to verify membership, a member could concat all the names in the database except theirs and hash the accumulation. If they want to verify another member, they just concat that member's name to their list and compare hashes. </li>
            <li><u>All or nothing disclosure:</u> If Alice has some secrets and Bob wants to know one of them, but Bob does not want to let Alice know what secret he wants to know. This can be solved by only disclosing one of the secrets. </li>
            <li><u>Key Escrow:</u> Need protocol to protect individual privacy while also allowing for court authorized wiretaps. To do this, <b>fair cryposystems</b> can be used. These break up the private key into pieces like secret sharing but the keys can also be individually verified to be correct. If a wiretap is ordered then all entrustees of the keys are sent warrants.</li>
        </ul>
